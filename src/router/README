* Introduction

To compile the Broadcom Linux Router package, you must have both
mipsel-linux and mipsel-uclibc toolchains in your PATH.

#ifdef BCMINTERNAL
/projects/hnd/tools/linux/hndtools-mipsel-linux/bin
/projects/hnd/tools/linux/hndtools-mipsel-uclibc/bin
#else
/opt/brcm/hndtools-mipsel-linux/bin
/opt/brcm/hndtools-mipsel-uclibc/bin
#endif

#ifdef BCMINTERNAL
You must also have the entire linux-router module checked out from CVS.
#endif

** Configuration

To configure the package, type "make menuconfig". The Linux kernel will
be configured as well.

** Compilation

To compile after configuring, type "make". The Linux kernel will be
built as well.

To compile only a particular module (e.g. rc), type "make rc".

** Installation

To package for direct installation, type "make install" or "make
package". Linux kernel modules will be installed as well.

If uClibc was selected, "make install" will create a linux.trx file in
"mipsel-uclibc/". If uClibc was not selected, a linux.trx file will be
created in "mipsel/".

** Cleaning

It is recommended that "make clean" be run after a configuration change
is made. By default, "make clean" will not clean the kernel. Uncomment
the last line of the "clean" target in the Makefile to enable kernel
cleaning.

* Customization

See config/Kconfig-language.txt for a description of the configuration
language used for user applications. Although its configuration program
appears similar, the Linux kernel uses a slightly different
language. See ../linux/linux/Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt.

To add a new user application to the package, edit config/Config and
name the module rule under the "Configuration" section of the
Makefile. If the module can be built, cleaned, and installed with the
generic rules located at the end of the Makefile, no further changes are
necessary. Otherwise, add additional rules for the module under the
"Overrides" section of the Makefile. "make <module>" should descend into
the module directory and compile the sources. "make <module>-install"
should install the appropriate binaries as if "$(INSTALLDIR)/<module>"
were the root directory. "make <module>-clean" should clean generated
files from the module directory.

See the rules for "www" for a simple example.
